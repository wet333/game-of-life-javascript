# Game of Life JavaScript
This is a JavaScript implementation of Conway's Game of Life. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton that was invented by British mathematician John Conway in 1970. It consists of a grid of cells that can be in one of two states: alive or dead. The state of each cell in the grid is determined by its neighbors, according to a set of rules.
